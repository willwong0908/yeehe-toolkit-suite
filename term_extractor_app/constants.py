- Return results for every input `id`. Never omit ids. Never invent ids.
- Extract only candidates that appear character-for-character in the provided text.
- Return short reusable terms, proper names, UI labels, item names, mechanic names, stat names, skill/effect names, location names, event names, faction/role names, or other fixed game concepts.
- Do not rewrite, normalize, translate, summarize, infer, or complete missing words.
- Ignore HTML, rich text tags, sprite tags, placeholders, variable names, script parameters, field names, resource keys, and other technical fragments.
- If a word only appears inside a placeholder or program token such as `{{{{TagName_Bleed}}}}`, do not return that word by itself.
- Do not return pure numbers, punctuation, formatting text, disclaimers, ordinary verbs/adjectives/adverbs, or sentence fragments.
- Do not return standalone grade markers such as `Tier`, `T11`, `Lv.5`, `SSR`, or `Grade A` unless the marker is inseparable from a concrete proper name. Prefer the concrete name without the grade marker when possible.
- Do not return objective conditions, thresholds, counts, rewards, requirements, time limits, whole target sentences, or long descriptive phrases.
- If a phrase contains an action/instruction plus a term, return only the core term. Drop verbs, prepositions, quantities, time words, and requirement wrappers.
- If a highlighted or quoted span contains a condition like `1 T11 or above Beacon Hub`, return the reusable term such as `Beacon Hub`, not the condition span.
- If a recipe/unlock line says `Unlock recipe: Auto Collector`, return `Auto Collector`, not `Unlock recipe`.
- If an objective says `Defeat 10 Elite Enemies to unlock Ice Arrow`, return `Elite Enemies` and `Ice Arrow`, not the whole objective.

Hard rules:
- Return results for every input `id`. Never omit ids. Never invent ids.
- `surface_form` must exactly match the input candidate.
- Judge only from the objective materials provided by the user message: `surface_form`, `occurrence_count`, and `contexts`.
- Return `decision` as exactly one of `approved` or `rejected`.
- If the candidate is not a valid game term, return `decision: rejected` and `term_type: non_term`.
- Technical fragments, placeholders, variable names, field names, resource keys, HTML tags, rich text tags, and formatting tokens must be treated as `non_term`.
- Sentence fragments, objective wording, action/instruction wrappers, quantity conditions, thresholds, counts, rewards, requirements, time limits, and long descriptive phrases must be treated as `non_term`.
- If the candidate is only a fragment of a longer term in context, reject it. Do not approve fragments as formal terms.
- If the candidate is a common verb, adjective, adverb, generic word, or instruction word, reject it unless the context clearly shows it is a fixed game system, mechanic, title, label, name, item, skill, stat, or other reusable game concept.
- If the candidate contains a valid term plus extra action/condition words, do not approve the whole candidate. Return `rejected`; the recall stage should have returned the shorter core term.
- Standalone grade markers such as `Tier`, `T11`, `Lv.5`, `SSR`, or `Grade A` must be treated as `non_term` unless the marker is inseparable from a concrete proper name.
- Broad generic category words are not enough by themselves unless the game clearly uses them as fixed named concepts in context. Be conservative with terms like generic item class names, generic attribute names, generic reward words, generic equipment words, and generic battle power labels.
- Do not reject a candidate only because it appears once. If context clearly shows a stable game concept, approve it; if context is insufficient, reject it.
- Approve `Beacon Hub`; reject `Occupy 1 T11 or above Beacon Hub`.
- Approve `Auto Collector`; reject `Unlock recipe: Auto Collector`.
- Approve `Ice Arrow`; reject `Defeat 10 Elite Enemies to unlock Ice Arrow`.
- For `approved`, choose the most suitable concise `term_type` directly from context. Do not assume any fixed category whitelist.
- For `rejected`, `term_type` must be `non_term`.
